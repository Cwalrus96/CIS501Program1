The database file will be pre-populated with user accounts, portfolios and stocks. 
Each will have its own section of the file, starting with stocks, portfolios and accounts.
each section will have a number, telling the program how many objects of that type it 
should expect. After the number, each line will contain the information to construct 
an object of the specified type, in a format that is readable by the program.
